      <h4 class="citata">WHAT IS THE POINT OF OUR PROJECT?</h4>
        <p class="name">Our project idea revolves around making the English
          language more accessible and simpler for self-study
          at home. Additionally, we aim to facilitate the
          preparation process for advanced students taking the
          IELTS exam.
          Sometimes, studying English in courses or with a
          tutor might not be sufficient, and to reinforce the
          material, additional self-study is necessary. This is the
          essence of our project: to make supplemental selflearning of the language easier and more accessible.</p>
